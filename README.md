Here's the source code for [my personal website](https://jdupont.github.io/).

This website would not have been possible without the help many open-source projects, including [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [material-ui](https://material-ui-next.com/), and others. You can find a complete list of all of the libraries I used in my [package.json](https://github.com/jdupont/jdupont.github.io/blob/Production/package.json).

For more details about this project, check out the [about page](https://jdupont.github.io/about) on my website.
