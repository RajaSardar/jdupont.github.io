I teamed up with a high school classmate (Dan Dudt) to build an app for our [local library system](http://ccls.org/). We started with a beta app that we presented to the library system board of directors; then, with their approval, we stepped up to a production release that ultimately got almost 2000 installs on the Google Play Store. All of our work was done on a volunteer basis in coordination with the library board of directors.

Dan and I had some experience with programming from school projects and small toy applications (think command line games and the like). We decided to put that experience to work on a piece of software that would help real users. When we realized that our local library system didn’t have an Android app, we found a perfect opportunity: an interesting project with community involvement and ready-made user base.

We started with a prototype app showcasing what we could do, then presented that app to the library system’s board of directors. After getting a lot of positive feedback and the library system’s blessing, we took the app to production on the Google Play Store.

Here’s some of the functionality we had in the finished product:

+ Browse and search the library catalog
+ User accounts:
    + View any checked out items
    + Place holds on available items
    + Renew your checked out items
+ See library information, including hours and locations
