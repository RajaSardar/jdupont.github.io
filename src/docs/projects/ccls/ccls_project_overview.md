projectTitle: "Chester County Library Android App"
---

I teamed up with a classmate ([Dan Dudt](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/graduate-students/dudt)) to build an Android app for [our local library system](http://ccls.org/). Features included:

+ Catalog search
+ Account management (placing holds, renewing items, and more)
+ Library information, like location and hours

With around 2000 installs, the app was a big hit with library patrons. Read on for a description of what I did in the project, dev ops details, how the project turned out, and what I learned.
