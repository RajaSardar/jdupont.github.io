I built this blog platform myself!

But wait - given all of the great blogging software already available for free, why would I chose to reinvent the wheel?

I've recently been learning about React and other technologies for building web apps, and building my own blog was a great opportunity to practice those new skills. I chose React as a front-end technology to extend the work I'd done in the Udemy course [Meteor and React for Realtime Apps](/blogs?title=react_and_meteor_for_realtime_apps). Then, I designed the blog according to Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) guidelines as a way to apply what I'd learned in Google's [Material Design course on Udacity](/blogs?title=material_design_for_android_developers).

If you'd like to know more about my experiences building this blog, you can check out [these blog posts](/archives/tags?tags[0]=Building this Blog), where I go into detail about my technical decisions and describe what I learned in the construction process. You can also take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/jdupont/jdupont.github.io/tree/Production), which is freely available on my GitHub.
