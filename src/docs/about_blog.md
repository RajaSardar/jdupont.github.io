I built this blog platform myself!

But wait - given all of the great blogging platforms already available for free, why would I chose to reinvent the wheel?

I've recently been learning about React and other technologies for building web apps, and building my own blog was a great opportunity to practice those new skills. I chose React as a front-end technology to extend the work I'd done in the Udemy course [Meteor and React for Realtime Apps](/blogs?title=react_and_meteor_for_realtime_apps). Then, I designed the blog according to Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) guidelines as a way to apply what I'd learned in Google's [Material Design course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862).

The blog is a static site hosted on Github Pages, with routing implemented using the methods described [here](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).  All of the [source code](https://github.com/jdupont/jdupont.github.io/tree/Production) is freely available on my GitHub.
