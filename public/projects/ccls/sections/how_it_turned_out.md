Dan and I wanted to build a project that helped real users. With almost 2000 installs, we achieved that goal and more.

Here's a look at some of our user statistics and feedback. All statistics are official numbers directly from the [Google Play Developer Console](https://developer.android.com/distribute/console/index.html), and most of the graphs are screenshots from that console as well. 

## Installation Statistics

For starters, our app was very popular. We had almost 2000 installs (1918 at the time of this writing). Here's a graph showing our installs per day over the lifetime of the app:

There's a big spike in January 2015, when we were averaging almost 200 installs a day. That spike was driven by our transition from beta to full public availability, which was also accompanied by advertisements from the Chester County to library patrons. After that initial spike, our installs per day stayed pretty steadily between 25 and 50 downloads per day. Here's how that adds up for cumulative lifetime installs:

The Google Play Store also gives more details about installs. For example, the following graph shows installs per Android version:

## User Feedback

Not only did we have a lot of users, we also managed to keep them pretty happy. Here's our ratings overview on the Play Store:

Here's a quote from one of those reviews:

Finally, we also received quite a bit of feedback from our beta users. Here's a quote showing early encouragement and some feature requests:

> I love the new app! Could you add the ability to sort checked out items by date? Also, could you add a field to the hold items indicating the date the item has to be picked up by? I see you are going to add overdrive. Could you also add Bookflix? Thanks!
