Building this blog platform was a great experience. I learned a lot, both technical and nontechnical, and I also identified some important areas I need to focus on when working on projects in the future.

Here are a few of my big takeaways.

## Project management is crucial to success.

Do you get your projects 80% done, and then can't seem to cross the finish line?

Because I find myself in that situation a lot, and building this blog platform made me realize I needed to improve my project management skills. Let me walk you through what happened.

I started out with a small list of key features, and a soft, self-imposed deadline of getting this blog deployed in a month or so.

That timeline was great at first. Then, while I was working, I saw a blog with a nice archive design, so I added that to the todo list. I also saw a guy who had hover effects on the photos, so I built that as well. Then my photo on the [About Me page](https://jdupont.github.io/about) wouldn’t stay circular while keeping the right aspect ratio, so I had to spend a while ironing that out. And while I was doing that, I saw another couple blogs with interesting ideas, so I tossed those in too...and so on and so forth.

In the end, my small list of key features turned into a really big list of cool features, I was spending a lot of time polishing the smallest details, and the unfinished 20% of this project wasn’t moving much at all.

When the six week mark rolled around, I knew something was wrong. All the work I was doing was fun, but it wasn’t getting me closer to deploying a finished blog. And since this project wouldn’t be much good to me unfinished, that was a problem.

So I took a step back. I took a look at how my current work (adding cool features) matched my goals (putting together a working blog). The answer was simple: it didn’t. A mix of feature creep and avoiding less interesting work meant that the time I spent on this blog wasn’t properly targeted to moving my project forward.

After that realization, I changed approaches. Instead of happy-go-lucky non-planning, I adopted a real project management methodology. I wrote out goals, culled my feature list, and set timelines for what I wanted to accomplish. Then I put all that information in a Trello board and set myself a weekly reminder to reevaluate my progress.

And it worked. I wasn’t able to build all the features I wanted, but this blog is now a polished and deployed project, and I can always add features later when time allows. Also, since I can see how my finished product performs in the wild, I have a better basis for determining the value of any additional features.

My key takeaway here is that project management is crucial. Without a clear project management strategy, I just ended up floundering about and decreasing my productivity. For all my projects going forward, I plan to establish goals and timelines, use a clear methodology, and leverage all the project management tools at my disposal.

## An emphasis on learning new skills will pay off.

I started this project to learn more about React and Material Design, and I achieved those goals.  Participating in the material-ui community exposed me to a lot of React skills and design strategies, some of which I now use extensively. 

But I also learned about a lot more than those two technologies. Designing and building this blog helped me learn a lot about single-page applications, forced me to explore a variety of project management strategies, and exposed me to a lot of other skills and concepts I wouldn’t have encountered otherwise.

This kind of incidental learning is crucial to expanding your skillset and horizons. It helps you realize the value of technologies and approaches that weren’t even on your radar before you started out. 

That’s why I need to keep learning new skills: not just for the skills themselves, but also for the opportunity to broaden my horizons. In my next side project, I’d like to try out an unfamiliar language, like Python, or focus on a new domain area, like machine learning.

## Community is a huge part of software development.

While building this blog, I worked with the [material-ui project](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) daily. I didn’t use only their code library, though. I also relied heavily on their [excellent documentation site](https://material-ui-next.com/) and on their [Stack Overflow community](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/material-ui).

So, I decided to give back to this community by participating both on Stack Overflow and in their open-source project. In the process, I realized that the community surrounding a software project is almost as important as the project itself.

The material-ui maintainers are open, friendly, and supportive. They’ve provided feedback, welcomed contributions, and helped me improve my software development skills. My first open-source contribution, for example, came as a direct result of the material-ui community making it easy for new developers to contribute to open-source. The maintainers mark certain issues as [good first issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/labels/good%20first%20issue), and provide clear instructions on how to resolve those issues, which helps new developers ease into the contribution process. They’ve also got an excellent set of contributor guidelines, which proved indispensable for me.

Going forward, I will pay a lot more attention to the communities surrounding the software I use. I’ll also make a more concerted effort to be an active participant in these communities, because that kind of participation is key to learning and growing as a software developer.

## Wrapping Up

Building this blog platform was a great learning experience that helped build my development skills, and also incentivized me to invest more in soft skills like project management and technical communication.

I’m going to use these takeaways to maximize the returns on my next set of side projects, so keep your eyes peeled for a blog post about my next steps.
